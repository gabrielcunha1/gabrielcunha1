## About Me

I’m **Gabriel**, a front-end developer in training focused on building **clean, responsive, and visually consistent web interfaces**.

My work is centered on **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, applying these technologies through **real projects**, including institutional websites and brand-inspired landing pages. I focus on layout structure, responsiveness, usability, and maintainable code.

I’m currently preparing for my **first junior front-end opportunity**, where I can grow technically, learn from experienced developers, and contribute with responsibility and consistency.
