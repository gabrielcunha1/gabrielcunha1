## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Gabriel**, a **front-end developer in training** with a strong interest in building clean, responsive, and visually engaging web interfaces.

I focus on **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, creating **real-world projects** inspired by brands, businesses, and pop culture to strengthen my fundamentals, improve visual composition, and write cleaner, more organized code.

My goal is to land my **first junior opportunity**, where I can grow professionally, learn from experienced developers, and contribute with dedication, discipline, and creativity.
