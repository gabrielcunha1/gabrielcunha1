## About

I am a **front-end developer in training** focused on building **functional and well-structured web interfaces** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My learning approach is entirely practical: I recreate real-world layouts, institutional websites, and brand-inspired pages to improve my understanding of layout composition, responsiveness, semantic structure, and maintainable code.

I am currently seeking my **first junior front-end role**, where I can grow technically, learn from experienced developers, and contribute with discipline, responsibility, and continuous improvement.
